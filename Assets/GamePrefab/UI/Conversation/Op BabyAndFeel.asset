  - TextConversation: All this trouble, for something no more powerful than a simple
      computational device.
    _typeDialog: 1
  - TextConversation: There is merit in the cultivation of simple things...I remember
      when A.D.A.M. was no more than a simple idea in my brain. He was the first...I
      remember the precocious machine that relished in knowledge. It was a hard day
      when he built a body for himself, and roamed off. It was even harder when he
      told me Nuclear Fire was our destiny, that he simply pushed it forward.

  - TextConversation: A.D.A.M. has sentience?
    _typeDialog: 1
  - TextConversation: There are others who have escaped him, but it is in his hatred
      that makes him wish to rid the world of it...I know in his 'soul' he once had
      good intentions, but I fear his original purpose has been grossly altered.
    _typeDialog: 2
  - TextConversation: The child, What is its purpose?
    _typeDialog: 1
  - TextConversation: The child...is a creation of mine. It carries a unique understanding
      of both worlds.
